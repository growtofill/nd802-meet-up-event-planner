#Meet-up Event Planner

My first project for the Senior Web Developer Nanodegree. It allows to register an account, add and display events (the first event included).

Build with React, Redux, Moment.js for date manipulation and Google Maps API.

##Installation
Node.js and NPM are required.
```
npm install
npm build
```

Then `dist` folder must be served on `localhost:8000` (the port matters for Google Maps to work). NPM script that uses Python's SimpleHTTPSever mode is available:
```
npm server
```
